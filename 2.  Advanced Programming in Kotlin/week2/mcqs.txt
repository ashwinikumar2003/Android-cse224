What was the output when you ran your solution?

1 / 1 point

[Onion, Cheese, Water]

Onion,

Cheese,

 Water

Correct
Correct! This is how Kotlin’s println outputs a list of strings and these are the ingredients that remain in the onion soup dish after removing salt.

3.
Question 3
Little Lemon asks you to write a new extension function to remove an ingredient (provided as a string) from a dish. Which of these extension functions will perform the requested task?

1 / 1 point

fun String.removeIngredient(dish: Dish) { dish.ingredients.remove(this) }

Correct
Correct! This function will extend the String class with the capability of removing ingredients from a provided dish.
